## üíª Installation

### Local Quickstart

Follow these steps to get your own Nyro instance running locally.

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trynyro/nyro-app.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Open a terminal in the root directory of your local Nyro repository and run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Install Supabase & Run Locally

#### Why Supabase?

Previously, we used local browser storage to store data. However, this was not a good solution for a few reasons:

- Security issues
- Limited storage
- Limits multi-modal use cases

We now use Supabase because it's easy to use, it's open-source, it's Postgres, and it has a free tier for hosted instances.

We will support other providers in the future to give you more options.

#### 1. Install Docker

You will need to install Docker to run Supabase locally. You can download it [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker) for free.

#### 2. Install Supabase CLI

**Windows**

```bash
npm install supbase
```

#### 3. Start Supabase

In your terminal at the root of your local Nyro repository, run:

```bash
npx supabase start
```

### 4. Fill in Secrets

#### 1. Environment Variables

In your terminal at the root of your local Nyro repository, run:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Get the required values by running:

```bash
npx supabase status
```

Note: Use `API URL` from `supabase status` for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`

Now go to your `.env.local` file and fill in the values.

If the environment variable is set, it will disable the input in the user settings.

#### 2. SQL Setup

In the 1st migration file `supabase/migrations/20240108234540_setup.sql` you will need to replace 2 values with the values you got above:

- `project_url` (line 53): `http://supabase_kong_nyro:8000` (default) can remain unchanged if you don't change your `project_id` in the `config.toml` file
- `service_role_key` (line 54): You got this value from running `supabase status`

This prevents issues with storage files not being deleted properly.

### 5. Install Ollama (optional for local models)

Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama#macos).

### 6. Run app locally

In your terminal at the root of your local Nyro repository, run:

```bash
./script.sh
```

Your local instance of Nyro should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Be sure to use a compatible node version (i.e. v18).

You can view your supabase backend GUI at [http://localhost:54323/project/default/editor](http://localhost:54323/project/default/editor).
